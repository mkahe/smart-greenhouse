# smart-greenhouse

The Smart Greenhouse is an Internet of Things (IoT) system designed to monitor and control a greenhouse environment using a range of sensors and actuators. The system uses sensor modules to collect data on temperature, humidity, air quality, and soil moisture, and actuator modules to control the HVAC, ventilation, watering, and lighting systems. The system can be controlled manually using a web or mobile application, or automatically using algorithms that make decisions based on the sensor data and preset thresholds. The system is implemented using a range of hardware and software components, including microprocessors, sensors, actuators, and a web application, and is designed to be scalable and adaptable to a wide range of applications. Despite its potential benefits, the system has a number of limitations, including its reliance on Internet connectivity, the accuracy and reliability of the sensor data, the range and capabilities of the actuators, and the complexity and cost of implementation. There are many ways in which the system could be improved in the future to increase its effectiveness and expand its capabilities, including the addition of more sensors, the development of advanced algorithms, the expansion of the actuator range and capabilities, and the improvement of user-friendliness and accessibility.
